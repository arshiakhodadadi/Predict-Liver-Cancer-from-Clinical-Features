# Predict-Liver-Cancer-from-Clinical-Features
This is a synthetic but medically realistic liver cancer classification dataset containing 5000 patient records and 14 columns. The data simulates real-world patient attributes that influence liver cancer risk, combining demographic, lifestyle, clinical, and biomarker-based features.

The dataset is designed for binary classification: predicting whether a patient has liver cancer (liver_cancer = 1) or not (liver_cancer = 0).

It can be used for developing and testing machine learning models in healthcare, especially in risk prediction, early diagnosis, and feature importance analysis.
